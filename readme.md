# Monarch tester

This curerntly isn't a ready to install lib, rather it's an app with an internal system for testing monarch. You can
copy the jest config and jest foledr to your project in order to test your monarch language def. If you'd like it as an
installable libarary DM me or open an issue and I might do just that.
